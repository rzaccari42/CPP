XXX (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP or CXX)
is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, adding object-oriented (OOP) features, 
it has since expanded significantly over time adding more OOP and other features;
as of 1997/XXX98 standardization, XXX has added functional features, in addition to facilities forlow-level
memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows,
and even later came features like generic (template) programming.
XXX is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide XXX compilers,
including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]
